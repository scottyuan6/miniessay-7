The project aims to investigate the effects of data processing errors on statistical analysis outcomes. It specifically explores how instrument memory limitations, inadvertent changes to data values, and decimal place adjustments can impact the mean estimation of a normally distributed variable. Using a simulated dataset with known alterations, the project employs statistical testing to assess whether the mean of the processed data significantly deviates from the expected value.
